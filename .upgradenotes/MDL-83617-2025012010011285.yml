    - message: >
        New Behat step `\behat_general::the_url_should_match()` has been added
        to allow checking the current URL. You can use it to check whether a
        user has been redirected to the expected location.

        e.g. `And the url should match "/mod/forum/view\.php\?id=[0-9]+"`
