        - The `\core_ai\form\action_settings_form` class has been updated to automatically include action buttons such as Save and Cancel.
        - AI provider plugins should update their form classes by removing the `$this->add_action_buttons();` call, as it is no longer required.

    - message: >
        - A new hook, `\core_ai\hook\after_ai_action_settings_form_hook`, has
        been introduced. It will allows AI provider plugins to add additional
        form elements for action settings configuration.
      type: improved

        - AI provider plugins that want to implement `pre-defined models` and display additional settings for models must now extend the `\core_ai\aimodel\base` class.
