        The `\mod_quiz\attempt_walkthrough_from_csv_test` unit test has been
        marked as final and should not be extended by other tests.


        All shared functionality has been moved to a new autoloadable test-case:

        `\mod_quiz\tests\attempt_walkthrough_testcase`.


        To support this testcase the existing `$files` instance property should be replaced with a
        new static method, `::get_test_files`.

        Both the existing instance property and the new static method can co-exist.

      type: changed
