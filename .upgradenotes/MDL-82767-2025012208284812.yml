        From now on, deleting an activity without Ajax will be consistent with
        deleting an activity using Ajax. This ensures that all activity deletions
        will use the recycle bin and avoid code duplication. If your format uses
        the old non-Ajax method to bypass the recycle bin it won't work anymore
        as the non-Ajax deletions are now handled in course/format/update.php.
