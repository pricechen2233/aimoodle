  core_course:
    - message: >-
        Now the core_courseformat\local\content\cm\completion output is more
        reusable. All the HTML has been moved to its own mustache file,
        and the output class has a new set_smallbutton method to decide wether
        to rendered it as a small button (like in the course page) or as a
        normal one (for other types of pages).
      type: improved
