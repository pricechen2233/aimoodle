        The old UI for moving activities and sections without javascript is
        not avaiable anymore from the actions dropdown. From now, on the only UI
        to move activities and sections is using the move action in the course
        editor. Format plugins can still use the old links to make the "move here"
        elements appear, but they will show deprecated messages. All the non-ajax
        moving will be removed in Moodle 6.0.
