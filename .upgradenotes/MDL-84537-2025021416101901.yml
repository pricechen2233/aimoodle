    - message: >-
        Aggregation types can access passed options set via the base class
        constructor in the `$this->options[]` class property. As such, their
        `format_value` method is no longer static and is always called from an
        instantiated class instance
      type: changed
    - message: >-
        New `$options` argument added to the
        `column::set_aggregation` method for system reports, to set aggregation
        type-specific options


        Report entities can call new `column::set_aggregation_options` to
        achieve the same
