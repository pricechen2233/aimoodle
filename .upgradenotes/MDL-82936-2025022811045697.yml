notes:
  core_reportbuilder:
    - message: >-
        The `render_new_report_button` method of the `core_reportbuilder`
        renderer has been deprecated. Instead, refer to the report instance
        `set_report_action` method
      type: deprecated
    - message: >-
        The base report class, used by both `\core_reportbuilder\system_report`
        and `\core_reportbuilder\datasource`, contains new methods for enhancing
        report rendering


        * `set_report_action` allows for an action button to belong to your
        report, and be rendered alongside the filters button;

        * `set_report_info_container` allows for content to be rendered by your
        report, between the action buttons and the table content
      type: improved
