notes:
  core_badges:
    - message: >-
        The fields imageauthorname, imageauthoremail, and imageauthorurl have
        been removed from badges due to confusion and their absence from the
        official specification. These fields also do not appear in OBv3.0.
        Additionally, the image_author_json.php file has been removed as it is
        no longer needed.
      type: removed
