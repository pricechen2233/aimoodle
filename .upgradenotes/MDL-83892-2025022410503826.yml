issueNumber: MDL-83892
notes:
  core:
    - message: >-
        A new method get_instance_record has been added to cm_info object so
        core can get the activity table record without using the $DB object
        every time. Also, the method caches de result so getting more than once
        per execution is much faster.
      type: improved
