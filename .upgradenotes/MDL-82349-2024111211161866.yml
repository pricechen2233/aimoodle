notes:
  core_courseformat:
    - message: >-
        A new core_courseformat\base::get_generic_section_name method is
        created to know how a specific format name the sections.
        This method is also used by plugins to know how to name the sections
        instead of using using a direct get_string on "sectionnamer" that
        may not exists.
