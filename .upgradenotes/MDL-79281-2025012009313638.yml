notes:
  core_question:
    - message: >-
        The `get_bulk_actions()` method on the base `plugin_features_base` class
        has been changed to allow a qbank view object to be passed through. This
        is nullable and therefore optional for qbank plugins which don't need
        to do so.
      type: improved
